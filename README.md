NICE Framework Work Roles


NICE Framework Workforce Categories and Specialty Areas

Securely Provision (SP): Conceptualizes, designs, procures, and/or builds secure information technology (IT) systems, with responsibility for aspects of system and/or network development.

- Risk Management (RSK) Oversees, evaluates, and supports the documentation, validation, assessment, and authorization processes necessary to assure that existing and new information technology (IT) systems meet the organization's cybersecurity and risk requirements. Ensures appropriate treatment of risk, compliance, and assurance from internal and external perspectives.

- Software Development (DEV): Develops and writes/codes new (or modifies existing) computer applications, software, or specialized utility programs following software assurance best practices.

- Systems Architecture (ARC): Develops system concepts and works on the capabilities phases of the systems development life cycle; translates technology and environmental conditions (e.g., law and regulation) into system and security designs and processes.

- Technology R&D (TRD): Conducts technology assessment and integration processes; provides and supports a prototype capability and/or evaluates its utility.

- Systems Requirements Planning (SRP): Consults with customers to gather and evaluate functional requirements and translates these requirements into technical solutions. Provides guidance to customers about applicability of information systems to meet business needs.

- Test and Evaluation (TST): Develops and conducts tests of systems to evaluate compliance with specifications and requirements by applying principles and methods for costeffective planning, evaluating, verifying, and validating of technical, functional, and performance characteristics (including interoperability) of systems or elements of systems incorporating IT.

- Systems Development (SYS): Works on the development phases of the systems development life cycle.




Operate and Maintain (OM): Provides the support, administration, and maintenance necessary to ensure effective and efficient information technology (IT) system performance and security.

Oversee and Govern (OV): Provides leadership, management, direction, or development and advocacy so the organization may effectively conduct cybersecurity work.

Protect and Defend (PR): Identifies, analyzes, and mitigates threats to internal information technology (IT) systems and/or networks.

Analyze (AN): Performs highly-specialized review and evaluation of incoming cybersecurity information to determine its usefulness for intelligence.

Collect and Operate (CO): Provides specialized denial and deception operations and collection of cybersecurity information that may be used to develop intelligence.

- Collection Operations (CLO): Executes collection using appropriate strategies and within the priorities established through the collection management process. 

- Cyber Operational Planning (OPL): Performs in-depth joint targeting and cybersecurity planning process. Gathers information and develops detailed Operational Plans and Orders supporting requirements. Conducts strategic and operational-level planning across the full range of operations for integrated information and cyberspace operations.

- Cyber Operations (OPS): Performs activities to gather evidence on criminal or foreign intelligence entities to mitigate possible or real-time threats, protect against espionage or insider threats, foreign sabotage, international terrorist activities, or to support other intelligence activities.

Investigate (IN): Investigates cybersecurity events or crimes related to information technology (IT) systems, networks, and digital evidence.

- Cyber Investigation (INV) Applies tactics, techniques, and procedures for a full range of investigative tools and processes to include, but not limited to, interview and interrogation techniques, surveillance, counter surveillance, and surveillance detection, and appropriately balances the benefits of prosecution versus intelligence gathering.

- Digital Forensics (FOR) Collects, processes, preserves, analyzes, and presents computer-related evidence in support of network vulnerability mitigation and/or crimina

  - [Law Enforcement/Counterintelligence Forensics Analyst (IN-FOR-001)](https://github.com/cyberintelpro/NICE-Framework-Work-Roles/blob/master/Investigate%20-IN/Digital%20Forensics%20-FOR/Law%20Enforcement%20Counterintelligence%20Forensics%20Analyst.md): Conducts detailed investigations on computer-based crimes establishing documentary or physical evidence, to include digital media and logs associated with cyber intrusion incidents.

  - [Cyber Defense Forensics Analyst (IN-FOR-002)](https://github.com/cyberintelpro/NICE-Framework-Work-Roles/blob/master/Investigate%20-IN/Digital%20Forensics%20-FOR/Cyber%20Defense%20Forensics%20Analyst.md): Analyzes digital evidence and investigates computer security incidents to derive useful information in support of system/network vulnerability mitigation.
