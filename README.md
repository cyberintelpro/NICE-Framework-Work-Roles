Determines capabilities of available collection assets, identifies new collection capabilities; and constructs and disseminates collection plans. Monitors execution of tasked collection to ensure effective execution of the collection plan.
  
  - [All Source-Collection Requirements Manager (CO-CLO-002)](https://github.com/cyberintelpro/NICE-Framework-Work-Roles/blob/master/Collect%20and%20Operate%20-CO/Collection%20Operations%20-CLO/All%20Source-Collection%20Requirements%20Manager.md): Evaluates collection operations and develops effectsbased collection requirements strategies using available sources and methods to improve collection. Develops, processes, validates, and coordinates submission of collection requirements. Evaluates performance of collection assets and collection operations.

- Cyber Operational Planning (OPL): Performs in-depth joint targeting and cybersecurity planning process. Gathers information and develops detailed Operational Plans and Orders supporting requirements. Conducts strategic and operational-level planning across the full range of operations for integrated information and cyberspace operations.

  - [Cyber Intel Planner (CO-OPL-001)](https://github.com/cyberintelpro/NICE-Framework-Work-Roles/blob/master/Collect%20and%20Operate%20-CO/Cyber%20Operational%20Planning%20-OPL/Cyber%20Intel%20Planner.md):  Develops detailed intelligence plans to satisfy cyber operations requirements. Collaborates with cyber operations planners to identify, validate, and levy requirements for collection and analysis. Participates in targeting selection, validation, synchronization, and execution of cyber actions. Synchronizes intelligence activities to support organization objectives in cyberspace.

  - [Cyber Ops Planner (CO-OPL-002)](https://github.com/cyberintelpro/NICE-Framework-Work-Roles/blob/master/Collect%20and%20Operate%20-CO/Cyber%20Operational%20Planning%20-OPL/Cyber%20Ops%20Planner.md): Develops detailed plans for the conduct or support of the applicable range of cyber operations through collaboration with other planners, operators and/or analysts. Participates in targeting selection, validation, synchronization, and enables integration during the execution of cyber actions.

  - [Partner Integration Planner (CO-OPL-003)](https://github.com/cyberintelpro/NICE-Framework-Work-Roles/blob/master/Collect%20and%20Operate%20-CO/Cyber%20Operational%20Planning%20-OPL/Partner%20Integration%20Planner.md): Works to advance cooperation across organizational or national borders between cyber operations partners. Aids the integration of partner cyber teams by providing guidance, resources, and collaboration to
develop best practices and facilitate organizational support for achieving objectives in integrated cyber actions

- Cyber Operations (OPS): Performs activities to gather evidence on criminal or foreign intelligence entities to mitigate possible or real-time threats, protect against espionage or insider threats, foreign sabotage, international terrorist activities, or to support other intelligence activities.
  
  - [Cyber Operator (CO-OPS-001)[https://github.com/cyberintelpro/NICE-Framework-Work-Roles/blob/master/Collect%20and%20Operate%20-CO/Cyber%20Operations%20-OPS/Cyber%20Operator.md]: Conducts collection, processing, and/or geolocation of systems to exploit, locate, and/or track targets of interest. Performs network navigation, tactical forensic analysis, and, when directed, executes on-net operations.

Investigate (IN): Investigates cybersecurity events or crimes related to information technology (IT) systems, networks, and digital evidence.

- Cyber Investigation (INV) Applies tactics, techniques, and procedures for a full range of investigative tools and processes to include, but not limited to, interview and interrogation techniques, surveillance, counter surveillance, and surveillance detection, and appropriately balances the benefits of prosecution versus intelligence gathering.
  
  - [Cyber Crime Investigator (IN-INV-001)](https://github.com/cyberintelpro/NICE-Framework-Work-Roles/blob/master/Investigate%20-IN/Cyber%20Investigation%20-INV/Cyber%20Crime%20Investigator.md): Identifies, collects, examines, and preserves evidence using controlled and documented analytical and investigative techniques.
